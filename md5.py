# MD5 sample hashing function by Estev√£o Neto
# NEVER USE THIS IN PRODUCTION! Always use whatever hashing functions 
# your language or framework natively offers, don't reinvent the wheel.

# MD5 in special is something you should never use if you want to achieve
# security. It has been broken since the late 90s/2000s and its usage
# today is mostly hash verification (e.g finding out if two files are identical)
