# PythonHashingAlgs
Just some random Hashing Algorithms written in Python. 
THESE ALGORITHMS ARE FOR STUDY AND SHOWCASE PURPOSES ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM IN REAL PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS!

# This is not on ITSME because...?
ITSME is my other project available here:
https://github.com/estevaojneto/ITSME
I decided to make this split from my more general project ITSME because hashing is a subject that I would like to explore in more depth - ITSME is more about *recycling* knowledge, and this one is more about *getting* new knowledge.
