# PythonHashingAlgs
Just some random Hashing Algorithms written in Python. 
THESE ALGORITHMS ARE FOR STUDY AND SHOWCASE PURPOSES ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM IN REAL PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS!

# This is not on ITSME because...?
ITSME is my other project available here:
https://github.com/estevaojneto/ITSME
I decided to make this split from my more general project ITSME because hashing is a subject that I would like to explore in more depth - ITSME is more about *recycling* knowledge, and this one is more about *getting* new knowledge.

# Handling of binary values
I am aware there are many libraries for dealing with binary values in Python, and this is how I would go by if I were building an actual application or system. My intention here is mostly about studying - thus, coming up with my own solution merely as an exercise. Again, do not use this in production, and please look into well-known, established libraries for dealing with binaries, hashing and cryptography in general.
